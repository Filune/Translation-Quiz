# Translation-Quiz

# What does this application do?

It takes a text file (dict.txt) with ten different words specified in two different languages (with synonyms possible), and then outputs a quiz for the user. **The GUI is entirely in Swedish**.

# How do I run this program?
1. Download the source folder.
2. You need to make sure that `App.java`, `Dictionary.java`, and `dict.txt` are in the same destination folder.
3. Open a terminal window & run `javac -encoding ISO-8859-1 App.java`.
3. Now run `java App`. Note that App is case sensitive.
